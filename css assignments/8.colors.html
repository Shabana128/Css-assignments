        The color purple is associated with a variety of meanings, including wisdom, creativity, royalty, power,
        ambition, and luxury. It can also represent magic, extravagance, peace, pride, independence, and wealth. As with
        other colors, purple is the subject of color psychology, which suggests that colors can have a powerful impact
        on moods and even behaviors.

        <h2>Butterfly</h2>
        <p>Butterflies are winged insects from the lepidopteran suborder Rhopalocera, characterized by large, often
            brightly coloured wings that often fold together when at rest, and a conspicuous, fluttering flight. The
            group
            comprises the superfamilies Hedyloidea (moth-butterflies in the Americas) and Papilionoidea (all others).
            The
            oldest butterfly fossils have been dated to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago, though they may have
            originated earlier.Butterflies have a very characteristic flying style. They usually do not fly in straight
            lines. Their style is well described by the children's version of their name: 'flutter-by'. The way they fly
            presumably makes them harder for birds to catch.</p>
